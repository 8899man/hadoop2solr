This project contains the code and data for the dzone
article on using Solr as a NoSQL endpoint for a Hadoop
workflow.

To build, run "ant job" at the top. This will create a
file called hadoop2solr-job-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the
build directory, suitable for use as a Hadoop job jar.

To run this job jar on a cluster:

hadoop jar hadoop2solr-job-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.bixolabs.tools.IndexTool \
	-input <path to HDFS directory with input files> \
	-output <path to HDFS directory for resulting index>

The output directory will contain a single 'part-00000' directory, which
will contain a set of Lucene files for a single index.
